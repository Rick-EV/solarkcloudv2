## How It Works
SolArkCloud retrieves solar system data from the MySolark Platform, where it's uploaded via your inverter dongle. It has no direct physical connection to your inverter. 

*Please note that this add-on only provides sensor data; it does not include pre-built Home Assistant cards to display the information.

## Getting Started
This add-on publishes sensor values to Home Assistant entities using the local API, requiring a long-lived access token.

### Creating a Long-Lived Access Token
Click your profile picture in the bottom left of the HA interface. Scroll down to the bottom and generate a long-lived token. The name isn't important for SolArk Cloud, but the token key isâ€”be sure to copy and save it for later use.

### Add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store
From the "Settings" menu item in Home Assistant's UI, go to "Add-ons". In the bottom right-hand corner, click "ADD-ON STORE". In the right-hand top corner, click the three dots and select "Repositories".
Paste the following repository link and click add, then close https://github.com/Rick-EV/SolarkCloudv2

Refresh the browser. Right at the bottom, you should now see the "SolarkCloudV2" add-on. Click on it to open the intro page, then click the "Install" button.

### Provide your MySolark.com credentials
After installing this add-on, make sure you enter all the required information on the configuration page. Note that if your intention is to update a Home Assistant installation with a different IP than the one where this add-on is installed, you need to generate the long-lived token on the Home Assistant instance where entities will be updated. 
*NOTE: In some cases, special characters in the password field may cause authentication issues. Also, SolarkCloudv2 will not be able to connect to your MySolark profile with MFA enabled.

*DO NOT USE localhost or 127.0.0.1 in the IP field; either use the actual IP or hostname. If you implemented an SSL certificate, it's mandatory to use the hostname assigned to the certificate and not the IP. 
(This addon runs in a docker and cannot reach your home assistant network on the local loopback name or ip)

If you are unsure of your SolArk inverter's serial number. Log in to Mysolark.com portal and copy the serial number from the "Inverter" menu item.
For multiple inverters, separate the inverter serial numbers with a semicolon; Example 123456;7890123

Make sure you also populate the "HA_LongLiveToken" field with the long-lived token that you created earlier on.

### Start the script
After entering all of the required information, you can go ahead and start the service script.

After starting the add-on, verify everything is working by clicking the "Log" tab. Scroll through the log to ensure sensor data is populated correctly. The log will display success or error messages based on the status of the integration.



# Sending Settings back to the inverter

### Intro
The Sol-Ark Home Assistant integration enables you to send settings to your inverter, with support currently limited to updating battery and system mode settings.


### How it works
After each loop, when the integration retrieves the various values, it will check the entity named [solarkv2_YOUR_INVERTER_SERIAL_NUMBER_settings]. If valid settings are found, they will be posted back to the MySolark Portal.

Once the settings are posted, the settings entity will be cleared to prevent the integration from repeatedly uploading the same settings in a continuous loop.

When running the integration for the first time, you will see an error message indicating that the entity does not exist, along with instructions on how to create it. However, the integration will also attempt to automatically create the entity. If the automatic creation fails, you can follow the instructions in the log to manually create it.

## Setting the settings entity value with a properly formatted string
Each setting must be separated by a semicolon (;).
Note that you cannot mix battery settings with system mode settings. I.E `"batteryCap": "100";"time2on":"true"` will not work.

### Battery settings example of a single setting:
`"batteryCap": "100"`
### Example to update multiple battery settings simultaneously:
`"batteryCap": "100";"batteryLowCap": "35"`

### System mode settings example of a single setting:
`"time2on":"true"`
### Example to update multiple system mode settings simultaneously:
###### Below will turn on the timer switch (peakAndVallery) and at the same time enable grid charge Timer 2 and Timer 3
`"peakAndVallery": "1";"time2on":"true";"time3on":"true"`
